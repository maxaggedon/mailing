# Building Emails

## Adding a subject

If you want to add a subject to your email, you can do so by adding a static `subject` property to your component.
This property should be a string or function that takes the props of your component and returns a string.

```tsx
type WelcomeProps = {
  name: string;
};

const Welcome = ({ name }: WelcomeProps) => (
  <Mjml>
    <MjmlBody>
      <MjmlColumn>
        <MjmlText>Hi {name},</MjmlText>
        <MjmlText>Welcome to our service!</MjmlText>
      </MjmlColumn>
    </MjmlBody>
  </Mjml>
);
Welcome.subject = ({ name }) => `Welcome ${name}!`;

export default Welcome;
```

Passing a subject into a `sendMail` call will override the subject defined on the component.

```tsx
await sendMail({
  to: "someone@something.com",
  subject: "This is a custom subjec",
  component: <Welcome name="Amelita" />,
});
```

Will send an email with the subject `This is a custom subject`.
